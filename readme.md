# QWARK
## the multi-platform PtAC, Phaser tiny-App Creator !


Are you looking to code with ease and fun tiny Game Apps ?

And more, how to distribute your wonderful tiny Apps to everyone, regardless of the operating system he uses, or if it's a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, windows, osx, linux, android, ios etc...

Qwark is the first step for this project.

A tiny environment that allow to code, run and publish your apps on a store !

What is currently working for now :
  - qwark should work on any platform
  - editing (basic) with codemirror (code folding and syntax coloring)
  - run
  - load from the cloud
  - save (publish) on the cloud... for registered user
  - fullscreen preview
  - the store is accessible at quark_web_adress/store 
  - debugging with chrome/chromium/edge/safari developper tools integrated in the explorer... on desktop
  - a couple of examples works nicely : phaser-basic, phaser-sound, phaser-sprites, phaser-game

What is not working/in progress :
  - some other examples work but have problem when resizing/rotating the screen
  - debugging request desktop explorer...
  - there is no doc...
  - missing relevant and easy to understand examples
  
Roadmap :
  - Version One of Qwark is Phaser 3.7 2D Game Engine oriented



## WARNING
If you remix this app, you will have to add a .env file with a variable named authorizedUser and the corresponding name (you can choose any value) that will be allowed to save/modify to the server some code... this a very basic identification code ! ... for only one use.... no comment...

## MINIMAL REQUIREMENT TESTED (but may work on older configuration) :

As far as you can install the 2023 (lower version may also work) Chrome/Chromium/Thorium,microsoft edge/safari(17 on osx) webbrower version 119? or more, or , (with the exception of iOS, where Safari is a must), you'll be able to achieve this easily !
(min requirement ios 12 with Safari, osx catalina 10.15 with Chrome/Chromium, windows 7 (with Thorium), windows 10/11 with Chrome/Chromium/Thorium/Edge, Linux with Chrome/Chromium/Thorium, Android 6 with Chrome/Chromium
It may also works well with other browsers but without the install app functionnality and offline mode.
