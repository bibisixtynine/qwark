# QWARK
## The online installable webapp inventor !

So you want to learn with fun how to code Apps ?

And more, how to distribute your wonderful Apps to everyone, regardless of the operating system he uses, or if it's a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, windows, osx, linux, android, ios etc...

As far as you can install a Chrome/Chromium webbrower (with the exception of iOS, where Safari is a must), you'll be able to achieve this easily !

Qwark is the first step for this project.

A tiny environment that allow to code, run and publish your apps on a store !

What is currently working for now :
  - qwark should work on any platform
  - editing (basic)
  - run
  - load from the cloud
  - save (publish) on the cloud
  - windowed and fullscreen preview
  - the store is accessible at quark_web_adress/store 
  - debugging with chrome developper tools integrated in the explorer... on desktop
  - a couple of examples works nicely : clock, basic-template, phaser-basic

What is not working/in progress :
  - the other examples work but have problem when resizing/rotating the screen
  - published webapps/store/qwark are "installable"... but doesn't install anything on the machine yet, so a valid internet connection is requested after installation
  - debugging request desktop explorer...
  - ugly ui, you can delete your files on the server if not pay attention... easy 
  - ugly ide (it's just e textarea)
  - there is no doc...
  - missing relevant and easy to understand examples
  
Roadmap :
  - Wondering for a version One of Qwark using Phaser 3.7 2D Game Engine only... could be a good step...
