# QWARK
## The online installable webapp inventor !

So you want to learn with fun how to code Apps ?

And more, how to distribute your wonderful Apps to everyone, regardless of the operating system he uses, or if it's a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, windows, osx, linux, android, ios etc...

As far as you can install a Chrome/Chromium webbrower (with the exception of iOS, where Safari is a must), you'll be able to achieve this easily !

Qwark is the first step for this project.

A tiny environment that allow to code, run and publish your apps !

What is currently working for now :
  - qwark should work on any platform
  - editing (basic)
  - run
  - load
  - save

What is not working :
  - publish only open a new window and run the app full-window
  - Qwark is "installable" as a webApp on iOS only... but need internet connection...
  - there is no doc...
